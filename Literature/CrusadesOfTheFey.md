# The Crusades of the Fey

The Crusades of the Fey is a holy crusade run by the Kingdom of Caldassil. An ideology of retribution sprouted in the Kingdom of Caldassil and quickly took over. Half the population believed that humans in Myrkjörðr were destroying nature and Talmundúr by shaping/burning wood and killing animals. Then a civil war happened inside the kingdom. Unfortunately, the ideologists won. The other side, who opposed this ideology, fled from Caldassil. Some even fled to Myrkjörðr and stayed there. Despite the lack of proof, many people believe that this happened a hundred years ago.

In AD 870, Caldassil's council decided to target a kingdom called Wulfscithia. Since the king of Wulfscithia at that time was young and wasn't experienced, combined with the fey's magic, he was manipulated easily. Now that Caldassil had control over Wulfscithia, they used the kingdom as a tool to start their crusade.

However, in AD 935, seers and völvas from a foreign kingdom foresaw the intentions of Wulfscithia and Caldassil. But instead of directly attacking Wulfscithia. They attacked Wulfscithia's neighboring kingdom, Vatakond. The events from this point in time to the present date are known as the Campaign of Wulfscithia.
