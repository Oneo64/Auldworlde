# The First Oddring Campaign Against Bandits

The First Oddring Campaign Against Bandits was a one-year military campaign run by King Alfþórr II. The king gathered five hundred soldiers to send out to destroy bandit camps. They were to return after a week if no more outlaws could be found. As a result, twenty-three camps were burned to the ground, and fifty outlaws were captured as slaves.

The soldiers were split into five groups, led by the jarls Oddbjörn, Hákon, Valdimarr, Háljarr, and Ljofnir. When the five groups returned, Oddbjörn's group was the last to return. They were the most successful, wiping out seven camps. Hákon's group destroyed five camps, and Valdimarr's and Háljarr's groups both destroyed four. Ljofnir's group was the least successful as they only destroyed three camps.
