An priceless, but recently made artifact, a stone tablet containing a poem in Ancient Grutorian, was made by a scribe of yore. This scribe lived in a forgotten Galabric settlement. But tragedy struck when it was attacked in result of a civil war, and was utterly abandoned. It was only several years after that unfortunate event did they remember this tablet. But when an adventurous group decided to search the ruins of this settlement, they found nothing. A group of fey, one dryad and several centaurs, had already taken the tablet. And that dryad was LÃ nassil.
