An priceless, but recently made artifact, a stone tablet containing a poem in Ancient Grutorian, was made by a scribe of yore. This scribe lived in a forgotten Galabric settlement. But tragedy struck when it was attacked in result of a civil war, and was utterly abandoned. It was only several years after that unfortunate event did they remember this tablet. But when an adventurous group decided to search the ruins of this settlement, they found nothing. A group of fey, one dryad and several centaurs, had already taken the tablet. And that dryad was Lànassil.

An ideology of retribution sprouted in the Kingdom of Wassatila, quickly taking over. Wassatila is an ancient kingom in Veldalfheimr, inhabited by dryads and centaurs. The idea of this ideology was the Men of Myrkjörðr were destroying nature, and even Talmundúr (God of Nature, Storms, and Luck) by burning wood, killing animals, and even go as far to call wizards cultists. There were just a little more fey that followed this ideology than the ones that didn't. The ones that opposed this ideology stayed far away from Wassatila, some even fled to Myrkjörðr.

Lànassil was one of the few that actively opposed it, joining in the local fey military that fought against this. A few years later when they attacked the region she lived in, they killed her tree and stole her tablet. Lànassil then fled to Myrkjörðr spent the rest of her life living in Lantheressil Forest.
