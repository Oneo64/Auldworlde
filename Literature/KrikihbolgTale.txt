In 1860 BCE, Haear was attacked by an invasion of earth and stone elementals, whom all came from a different plane. After the people of Haear defended themselves, a group of mercenaries were sent by King Anzudengot to find its source and stop it. They travelled to Krikihbolg, a fortress embedded inside a massive cavern. They entered the fortress and soon found an elemental portal, the source of their foes. They destroyed the portal that lead the elementals to Myrkjörðr, stopping the invasion.
