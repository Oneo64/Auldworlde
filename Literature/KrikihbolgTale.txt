The Krikihbolg Tale is an ancient tale. The details are mostly lost, but it is retold as a short story about a group of mercenaries who were sent to an ancient ruin to stop an invasion. This tale shares similarities to the Legend of Hondaf, both being stories about an attack from a a different plane. Its possible that the Krikihbolg Tale takes place right after the Legend of Hondaf.

In 1860 BCE, the Haearic Empire was attacked by an invasion of earth and stone elementals, whom all came from a different plane. After the people of Haear defended themselves, a group of mercenaries were sent by King Azudengot to find its source and stop it. They were Aiobik, Iskom, and Borlom. Aiobik was the navigator, and Borlom was to bring a special concoction to the portal and destroy it.

After the last elemental crumbled, Iskom was tasked to make a special concoction that would explode. Then, the three set out on foot to the fortress. When they left the settlement, they saw irregular trails of mud and pebbles, and decided to follow them. Entering Krikihbolg, a fortress embedded inside a massive cavern, they saw the fortress looming in the middle of the dark. They lit their candles and soon, they found the elemental portal, the source of their foes. Borlom destroyed the portal with Iskom's concoction, stopping the invasion.
