# The Inglimparan Conquest

The year is about 1800 BCE. An ancient kingdom, Inglimpara, launched a conquest, now retold as the Inglimparan Conquest. The kingdom sought to conquer the world. So first, they assailed Hathklosh and took it over. A few years later, they took Borusdalis, and then again another, Kiliidhuuk.

After many years, in 1760 BCE, Haear, a powerful kingdom, collapsed. The kingdom was split into Borusdalis and Veilodin, but Inglimpara was quick to destroy Borusdalis. The people of Borusdalis fled east and formed Borusdaliandur.

After many years, the kingdoms Borusdaliandur and Veilodin both banded together and worked to defeat Inglimpara. They targeted Inglimpara-occupied Kiliidhuuk and captured its capital.

After a long time of planning and preparation, the two kingdoms were ready for the final Invasion of Inglimpara. They attacked at night, and with the cover of darkness, they successfully took over Inglimpara and ended the conquest they had run. During the battle, the king of Inglimpara was slain by an arrow fired from the Borusdaliandurian king's knight, who stood on a hill where they set camp.
