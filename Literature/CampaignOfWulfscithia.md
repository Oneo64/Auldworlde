# The Campaign of Wulfscithia

*This is part of a greater conflict called the Crusades of the Fey.*

In AD 870, King Wilfriþe of Wulfscithia passed away. His son inherited the throne from him. But over the next few years, evil fey corrupted the new king and manipulated him, using him as leverage for their crusade against men. Using him, he spread propaganda throughout the kingdom to make his people believe demons possessed other foreigners.

## The first strike
The year is AD 935. King Wærmund now holds power in Wulfscithia. From their seeresses, the king of Oddarsveldi, King Alfþórr the First, knew what the fey were trying to do. They struck first, invading the village of Antaragen in Vatakond. They successfully seized it and turned it into an outpost of their own. The kingdom launched another raid, this time on Bravosh.

The kingdom Wulfscithia reached out to Vatakond and offered help. Vatakond accepted.

A year later, Vatakond attacked Bantusaem, Centruma. But they couldn't get past their defenses and retreated. However, King Gardorus, the current ruler of Centruma at the time, knew of this and wasn't happy. He planned revenge and ordered an attack on Ainattor, Vatakond. The village was destroyed.

## The second strike
Many years have passed. The year is AD 940. King Alfþórr had passed away, and his son, Alfþórr II, took the crown. But now Oddarsveldi is prepared. After the campaign to destroy bandit camps, the king ordered the first invasion of Wulfscithia, but it failed.

The year is now AD 968. Wulfscithia decided to begin their attack on Þuryngard, the capital of Oddarsveldi. But before they could reach the fortress, their army was intercepted by Oddarsveldi's army and quickly fled.

### Pillaging of Álahringr
At the same time, Vatakond raided Álahringr. During the invasion, one of the centaurs, named Shafklimper, tried to set fire to the community hall. The fire caught on the roof, but it couldn't spread well because of a windy day. The fire was quickly extinguished by one of the locals. Shafklimper galloped back to the centaur ranks, avoiding five arrows that were shot at him. Álahringr was half-ransacked.

Álahringr's local militia was able to defend themselves from the would-be massacre that the centaurs of Vatakond planned. Unfortunately for Shafklimper, the seer of Álahringr cursed him and he died three days later. Álahringr has recovered now and is doing fine.
