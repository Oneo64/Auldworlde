# Chapter 1: Recuitment in the Village
In a rugged meadow that bordered a forest, there was a village. This village was a big village, but smaller than a town. Houses were long, bearing warm tarf roofs and a small chimney on top. A river ran by the village, and a bridge connected the two sides of it. As peaceful as it seemed, two watchtowers stood near the forest, another one near the bridge.

Sága went from door to door, looking to get the attention of their residents. Before her grandfather died, her father promised to bring a company of people to the new land.

After her advertisement was rejected by the local rascal, she left the small shack and moved on to a rather well-looking longhouse. It was surrounded by a dead hedge enclosure, a dirt path leading to the door. This family's farms were located to the left, and a few cattle fenced to the right.

She recognised this house. It belonged to Algord, whose sons went on an adventure to an ancient castle ruins. She heard the blond son came back a different man, cursed by a wraith.

She stopped in front of their door. She held her helmet close to her side, trying to look as presentable as possible. She reached out her free hand, and knocked on the door thrice.

A man opened the door and stepped out. He must be the father, as he looked at least fifty. He looked at her and asked, "Who are you?"

"Good day, I'm Sága. We are arranging a journey to the new land Agmundr found. Would you be intrested in...?"

"Agmundr? The explorer who claimed to have found land in the north?"

"Yes," Sága confirmed. "My father is arranging it. And he's already gathered twenty!"

"Why should I send my sons on your journey? I would rather them be successful, here in Álahringr, than live on some island." the man said. He didn't trust Sága nor her father. In fact, he didn't trust a lot of people in the village.

"Wulfscithia won't bother them there," she responded. "I'm sure they will also find success there."

For a moment, the man considered her offer. "I will talk to them about this."

"Thank you," she said. The man closed the door, and Sága slightly relaxed. She left the enclosure, satisfied.

The fire was low when Algord sat at the head of their long table. "Alfrir. Ljörn. Sit down, please. Let Ulfnir help your mother serve." The two sons watched as their eldest son helped Mifrún bring bowls of stew to the table. Soon, they served themselves and sat in their seats. Algord nodded and they began to eat. Their meal was simple. It was a stew, made with several eggs and potatos. They ate quietly, the only sounds that were heard were the faint chewing and the flicker of the hearth's fire.

Algord finished his meal first. He glanced across the table, watching his children finish. They were all well above twenty winters, and yet, still lived in the same house. "Alfrir. Ljörn." He said. "See me after dinner. I have news for both of you."

They silently acknoledged his request.

After dinner ended, he sent his daughter and first-born son away to tend their cattle. Once they stepped out of the door, Algord looked to his youngest two sons. He called them to the back where unused things, kitchen utensils, and farming tools were stored. Alfrir and Ljörn followed him. They stopped in front of him, suspecting something was going on.

"I recieved an invitation from Hjalvir's daughter for a colonising company. Apparently, her father finally decided to act upon his grandfather and settle in his land. I believe this can help you to better start your lives."

"What do you mean?" asked Ljörn, the older of the two.

"This gives you a better oppritunity to live a better life. Don't you remember several winters ago? You were shot by an arrow. No one wants that to happen again."

Ljörn hesitated by the idea of leaving home to an unknown land. But Alfrir, the younget son, brightened up at the thought of adventure. "I will go," he said.

"Good, I hoped you would," the father said. He turned to Ljörn, the other son. "You?"

"I... don't think-" he started, but was cut off by Alfrir.

"Ljörn, think about it! We could become-"

"Alfrir!" Algord raised his voice, shutting the son down. "Let your brother decide."

Alfrir was quiet for a moment. He nodded.

"Tomorrow you may come back and talk to me again," Algord said, glancing at Ljörn as he calmed back down. "Good night."
