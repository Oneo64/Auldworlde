# Chapter 1: Sea Paranoia
A longboat had its full sail, carried by the wind. It was almost dusk, for they could tell by the bit of orange sunlight peeking through the cloudy sky. The boat carried a plank in the back, a black circular symbol drawn on its surface, which seemed to glow red in the shade.

A blond man sat on his seat, boredly looking out into the ocean. He lowered his head, looking down at the amulet that he wore. His fingers trembled slightly as he held the metallic symbol, hoping it would provide him with some protection.

"Are you still thinking about Álahringr?" a low voice said behind him. The blond man turned around and saw his brother leaning towards him, his voice almost drained by the wind. He could tell his brother was slightly amused.

The blond man recalled two days ago when he was persuaded by his brother to join Hjalvir on a journey to a new land. Hjalvir, who he proclaimed himself as the most successful explorer in the village. He remembered when Sága, the explorer's daughter who still thinks he has been cursed by a wraith, promoted him to her father since she thought he would be a useful supernatural guidebook.

The blond man didn't respond for a moment. "Yes," he grumbled.

"I told you this land would be prosperous," said his brother. "And they're going to Fjörðvík, father is. You need not worry about them."

The blond man looked back at the front of the ship. He could still feel that annoying sensation of dampness in his socks. "How long do you suppose this traveling will last?" he complained.

The brother was about to speak, but was interrupted by a man who stood on the bow. "The wind has dimmed!" he loudly remarked. He was accompanied by a shorter woman, no doubt his daughter. He turned around, facing all the other men stationed at their seats, and the women who watched over the cargo. He had short black hair that seemed to merge well with his beard, and a pair of pale green eyes that held a withering gaze.

"Right, all of you! Get yourself an oar and prepare rowing," the man who stood on the bow said with a commanding voice. He glanced down at the compass he held and turned slightly to the right. He pointed in that direction. "Northeast," he added.

The rowers stood from their seats to gather their oars. The blond man did the same. He sat back down and lowered the head of the oar into the water and glanced into the seawater. He took a good look at himself again to remind himself he was still there. He was long-haired, colored more like old wheat than really blond. His pale blue eyes were shaped like a droopy dry leaf, as if he hadn't had a good night's sleep in days.

Then, he thought he saw something move in the water. His heart quickened, but he couldn't look away from the water. Then, the water started moving—no, the boat was moving.

"Ljörn," his brother called, taking him out of his trance. "What? Oh. Sorry," the blond man mumbled. He waited for the other's next stroke and rowed his oar with them.
