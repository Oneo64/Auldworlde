# Prologue
In a rugged meadow that bordered a forest, there was a village. This village was big, yet smaller than a town. Houses were long, bearing warm turf roofs and a small chimney on top. Faint smoke flowed softly out of the chimney holes; it was only spring, and the snow had just melted, leaving behind dull grasslands and a few batches of petite white flowers. A river ran by the village, and a wooden bridge connected the two sides of it. As peaceful as it seemed, two watchtowers stood near the forest, another one near the bridge.

Sága went from door to door, seeking to get the attention of the residents. Before her grandfather died, her father promised him to bring a company of people to the new land.

After the local rascal rejected her advertisement, she left the small shack and moved on to a rather well-looking longhouse. It was surrounded by a dead hedge enclosure with a dirt path leading to the front door. This family's farms were located to the left, and a few cattle fenced to the right. She recognised this house. It belonged to Algord, whose sons went on an adventure to an ancient castle ruin. She heard the blond son came back a different man, cursed by a wraith.

She stopped at their door. She held her helmet close, trying to be as presentable as possible. She reached out her free hand and knocked on the door thrice.

A man answered the door. He had bronze jewelry, his circlet holding his old blond hair away from his face. He must be the father for he seemed at least fifty. He asked, "Who are you?"

"Good day, I'm Sága. We are arranging a journey to the new land Agmundr discovered. Agmundaland! Would you be interested in...?"

"Agmundr? The explorer who claimed to have found land in the north?"

"Yes," Sága confirmed. "My father is arranging it. And he's already gathered twenty!"

"Why should I send my sons on your journey? I would rather see them become successful, here in Álahringr, than live on some wild land," the man said, a hint of his glare in the way his eyes shone. He didn't trust Sága nor her father. In fact, he didn't trust many in the village, let alone to take his sons to a foreign island!

"Our enemies won't bother them there," she responded. "I'm sure they will also find success on the land."

For a moment, the man considered her offer. "I will talk to them about this. When will they leave?"

"Two days," she said. The man gave a slow nod.

"Thank you," she said again. The man closed the door, and Sága slightly relaxed. She left the enclosure, satisfied.

The hearth's fire was low when Algord sat at their long table's head. The room was dimly lit, but it was warm. "Alfrir. Ljörn. Sit down, please. Let Ulfnir help your mother serve."

The two sons stopped and sat down. They watched as their eldest son helped Mifrún bring bowls of stew to the table. Soon, they served themselves and sat in their seats. Algord nodded, giving them the signal to begin eating. Their meal was simple. It was a slice of bread paired with an egg and potato stew. They ate quietly, the only sounds that were heard were the faint chewing and the flicker of the hearth's fire.

Algord finished his meal first. He glanced across the table, watching his children finish. They were all well above twenty winters, and yet, still lived in the same house. "Alfrir. Ljörn." He called them again. "See me after dinner. I have news for both of you."

They silently acknowledged his request.

After dinner ended, he sent his daughter and first-born son away to tend their cattle. Once they stepped out of the door, Algord looked to his youngest two sons. He called them to the back where unused things, kitchen utensils, and farming tools were stored. Alfrir and Ljörn followed him. They stopped in front of him, suspecting something was going on.

"I recieved an invitation from Hjalvir's daughter for a colonising company. Apparently, her father finally decided to act upon his grandfather and settle in his land. I believe this can help you to better start your lives."

"What do you mean?" Ljörn inquired, already unsure about joining the company.

"This gives you a better opportunity to live a better life. Don't you remember several winters ago? You were shot by an arrow. No one wants that to happen again."

Ljörn hesitated by the idea of leaving home to an unknown land. But Alfrir, the younger son, brightened up at the thought of adventure. "I will go," he said.

"Good, I hoped you would," the father said. He turned to Ljörn, the other son. "You?"

Ljörn didn't think it was a good idea. "I... don't think-" he started, but was cut off by Alfrir.

"Ljörn, think about it! We could become-"

"Alfrir!" Algord raised his voice, shutting the son down. "Let your brother decide."

Alfrir was quiet for a moment. He nodded, lowering his gaze a little.

"Tomorrow you may come back and talk to me again," Algord said, glancing at Ljörn as he calmed back down. "Good night."
