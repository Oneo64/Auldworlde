# Chapter 1: Sea Paranoia
Two longboats had their full sails flapping, carried north by the strong wind. It was almost dusk, for they could tell by the bit of orange peeking through the cloudy sky. A man stood on the bow of the leading ship. He was accompanied by a shorter woman with a similar face, no doubt his daughter.

The longboat was made of dark wood, tightly interlocked and sealed with resin. It bore its sail red with a blue cross, rough by the thick flax fibers.

"Rain," the man muttered darkly. Smelling the air for an oceany scent was out of the question, but he could tell by how dark the clouds were.

A blond man sat on his box, boredly looking out into the ocean. He lowered his head, looking down at the amulet he wore. His fingers trembled slightly as he held the cold metallic symbol, hoping it would provide him with some protection. He tucked it back into his cloak, his hands relishing the warm wool.

He glanced at the stern, where a plank rested against the cargo. A black circular symbol drawn on its surface; it seemed to glow red in the shade. He knew that was the symbol of a Vegvísir. He heard that such a symbol wouldn't let any tempest deter them, even if the waves maddened.

"Hey. Are you still thinking about Álahringr?" a low voice said behind him. The blond man turned around to see his brother leaning towards him, his voice almost drained by the wind. He could tell his brother was amused.

The blond man recalled two days ago when he was persuaded by his brother to join Hjalvir on a journey to a new land. Hjalvir was the explorer who proclaimed himself as the most successful explorer in the village. He remembered when Sága, the explorer's daughter, showed up at their doorstep to advertise the expedition. He remembered walking on the streets of Álahringr, overhearing her promoting him to her father, since she thought he would be a useful mentor, like a guidebook for the supernatural. He wasn't.

The blond man didn't respond for a moment. "Alfrir," he sighed, his voice low. "I-"

"I told you this land would be prosperous," said his brother, unintentionally cutting off the words of the blond man. "And they're going to Fjörðvík, father is. The war won't touch them there. You need not worry about them."

The blond man let out a breath. He turned away. He could still feel that annoying sensation of dampness in his socks. He could still taste the basic flavour of fish in his mouth. "How long will this travelling last?" he complained.

"The explorers took three days," his brother answered. "I heard."

Hearing this was the last day he would spend at sea, the blond man allowed a small smile on his face.

His brother was about to speak. But before he could say anything, he was interrupted by Hjalvir, the man who stood on the bow. "The wind has dimmed!" he loudly remarked.

Both the blond man and his brother turned to face Hjalvir.

Hjalvir had short black hair that seemed to merge well with his beard, and a pair of pale green eyes that held a withering gaze. He faced everyone: the men who sat on their seats, and the women who watched over the animals and cargo.

"Right, all of you! Get yourself an oar and prepare rowing," he said with a commanding voice. He looked into the sky, noting where the sun sat. He lowered his gaze back down at the horizon and pointed there. "Northeast," he added.

The rowers stood from their seats to gather their oars. The blond man did the same. He sat back down and lowered the head of the oar into the water.

The blond man glanced at his own visage, wavering on the water surface. He took a good look at himself again, reminding himself he was still there. He was long-haired, coloured more like old wheat than golden blond. His pale blue eyes were shaped like a droopy dry leaf, as if he hadn't had a good night's sleep in days. His nose wasn't straight either; rather, it was slightly hooked.

Then, he thought he saw a shadow move in the water. His heart quickened, but he couldn't look away from the water. He saw a gnarly, deathly face rise from the water, like it was dead for at least a hundred years. The water started moving—no, the boat was moving.

"Ljörn!"

The blond man jumped, his trance instantly disappearing as he heard his brother call him.

"What?" the blond man sharply asked. He was confused. He just noticed the other men were already rowing. "Oh, sorry," he apologised. He waited for the other men's next stroke and rowed his oar with them.

An hour later, the clouds darkened. The winds started to pick up again. "Sails down!" Hjalvir ordered.

As Ljörn rested his hands and shoulders, he looked at the horizon for the new land his brother was hyped about. It appeared as a thick, dark line across the curves of Myrkjörðr. But before he could get a better look, a haze gathered and blurred the land into the ocean.

Hjalvir called one of his men over. They talked in quiet voices. His assistant left the bow to the stern and opened it: salted fish.

<!--TODO!-->

Ljörn felt the first drops of rain hit his nose. "Mmmh," he grumbled.

It began to pour rain. Every time a raindrop hit the boat near the Vegvísir, it seemed to dry almost instantly. Soon, the water began to flood the ship.

The crew members kept the boat from sinking, scooping up water with buckets and dumping it into the ocean. The waves were bigger now, but the Vegvísir seemed to keep them from sinking the ship.
