Ljörn, a northman suffering from PTSD, is pressured by his brother Alfrir to join him in traveling to a new land to settle. After meeting the shore of the new land, the group must try to establish a farmstead without succumbing to the various threats that dwell there.

They arrive at the land. A few hours after arrival, Hjalvir arranges an exploring team to explore the nearby forest. Ljörn, Alfrir, Ingólfr, Rúna, and Sága are arranged. Ljörn and Alfrir were chosen because of their experience with supernatural creatures, Ingólfr is to lead, Rúna to identify herbs, and Sága because she's Hjalvir's daughter.

They are visited by a tribe of trolls. Hjalvir manages to make peace with them, and they trade items. But the trolls get angry when they offer metals. They leave the settlement.

The trolls eventually attack the settlement. They scare them away with superior weaponry.

Ljörn is called again to another exploration team. They set out for the nearest mountain, looking for a rare herb.
