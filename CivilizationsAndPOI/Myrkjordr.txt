Myrkjörðr is the home world of men, trolls, demi-humans, and many other creatures. Trees grow there and grass covers the ground. Mountains have risen to create natural borders and beautiful scenery. It is the home of many kingdoms and empires, and many stories are told there. Despite all, people still wage war over political beliefs, religion, hatred, and conquest.
