The Golden Forests is a large mixed forest that covers the land between Centruma and Rotherland. This forest is often bright, and its trees bear leaves that are green to yellow to orange. Then, the forest floor is covered with light green shrubbery. The reason why it's called the Golden Forests is because of the warm colors the forest has.
