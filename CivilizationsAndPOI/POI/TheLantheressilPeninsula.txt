The Lantheressil Peninsula is located southwest of Herthland and south of Saxia. It is covered by the Lantheressil Forest, a dark, murky forest of towering pines and ferns that can grow up to one and a half meters. There is an ethereal ethereal blue mist that seemingly never dissipates away from the peninsula, no matter how strong the wind is or how clear the sky is. There has been rumors of frost dragons living here.
