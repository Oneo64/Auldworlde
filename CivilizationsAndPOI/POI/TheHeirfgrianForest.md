The Heirfgrian Forest is a murky redwood forest south of the Mountains of Bark. The Centaurs of Heirfgria roam this forest, which has a moon shrine built somewhere within it.

## The forest
The Heirfgrian Forest is dark and murky, where tall redwood trees cast dark shadows in the forest, making sunlight scarce. Smaller trees grow under these redwood trees, but they cannot grow as tall as the redwood trees. The ground is covered with a fine layer of dried leaves, with bushes growing only in forest openings.
