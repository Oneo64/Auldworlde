The Northern Northmannish Forests are dark coniferous forests primarily composed of tall pine trees. There are also a few firs and spruces, but they are dwarfed by the pine trees. There's usually little to no undergrowth, but in the morning, dense fog can gather in this forest, heavily obscuring your vision.
