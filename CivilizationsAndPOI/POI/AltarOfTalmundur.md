The Altar of Talmundúr (Oddarish: *Talmundúrsaltari*) is a small pyramid built with stone atop a hill, located on the peninsula northwest of Oddarsveldi, or north between the road from Oddarsveldi to Heorthland. There are about thirty-something steps from the bottom to the top of the pyramid.

At the top of the pyramid, there is a small, courtyard-like space, and in the middle, the hearth of the altar. The hearth of the altar is circular, like a forge or a well, and is filled with tar which seems to burn brightly and eternally.

The hill on which this altar is built is surrounded by a forest. A rugged path that leads to this altar emerges from the forest.
