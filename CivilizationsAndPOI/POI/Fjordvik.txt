Fjörðvík is a village built on a fjeld that overlooks the ocean, at the west coast of Oddarsveldi. It's isolated except for a "bridge" that connects this fjeld to the mainland. Fjörðvík is often a sight-seeing point in the northern regions because of its oceanic scenery and fireflies.


[[SETTLEMENT]]
Fjörðvík is surrounded by a low wooden fence, which keeps people from falling off the cliff that surrounds it. There is a path that leads down to the shores, where there is a harbor built there.

Halfway along the path to the harbor, there is a grove of pines and no undergrowth. The route is lined with torches on both sides that provide a source of light. On certain nights, fireflies come out in the grove, and some even fly over to the village.

The natural bridge connecting the fjeld to the mainland has a wooden wall, with four guards stationed on the wall. The guards have a small blowing horn.

Two guards patrol the path to the harbor, and another two watch the harbor. Every morning, the guards at the wall blow their horn once continuously to signal safety. When a threat is seen, they blow twice with the second blow longer than the first. 



[[LOCAL TRADING]]
Rye is mainly grown here because it is resistant to the cold and can grow in poor soil. Traders trade rye, tuna, and salmon with other settlements for things like iron and other resources.



[[SPECIFIC BELIEFS]]
Grove: The grove is believed to be the home of three dryads. Harming or burning a tree can get you a slash across the palm of your hand. Continuous burning or destruction will get you a beating, exile, or removal of a finger.
