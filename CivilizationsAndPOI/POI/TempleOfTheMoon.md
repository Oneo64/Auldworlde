The Temple of the Moon is an ancient structure located on a plateau on the northwest coast, dedicated to the moon. From the bottom, gravel paths lead up to a single, high hill. A bell tower made of limestone sits on the hill.

This place is occasionally visited by Heorthlandic pilgrims, who consider this tower a sacred place.

It's rumored that it was built by alfar, but no one knows who built it, or why.
