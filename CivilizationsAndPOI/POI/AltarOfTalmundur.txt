The Altar of Talmundúr (Talmundúrsaltari) is a small pyramid built with stone atop a hill. There are about thirty-something steps from the bottom to the top of the pyramid.

At the top of the pyramid, there is a small, courtyard-like space, and in the middle, the hearth of the altar. The hearth of the altar is circular, like a forge or a well, and is filled with tar which seems to burn brightly and eternally.

The hill on which this altar is built is surrounded by a forest.
