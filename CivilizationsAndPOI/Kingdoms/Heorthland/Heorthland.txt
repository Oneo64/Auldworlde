Heorthland, or Heorþland, is a major northern kingdom in Myrkjörðr.



[[LONNCLÆDE]]
This castle is a large ring fortress made of stone, built on top of a small circular hill about 5 meters above the ground. This hill is surrounded by wooden spikes that protrude outwards. The diameter is approximately 80 meters, and the buildings inside are made of stone instead of wood. Inside the ring fortress, there are four longhouses with turf roofs built in a square in the center of the ring fortress. One for the queen and her family, two for servants and guards, and one for storage.



[[TRADE]]
Heorthland mainly exports timber, and silver. They trade mostly with Oddarsveldi.



[[MILITARY]]
Heorthland has around 600 people in their army, but most live in their homes.
