Oddarsveldi is a major kingdom in Myrkjörðr. The kingdom is one of the largest kingdoms in the north. Risen from a small village, they have slowly taken control of the north and northeast areas of the western lands.

## History
Oddarsveldi rose to power from a small village named Hrattvekr. When Oddr the First led a defensive force against aggressive trolls, he was made king. Years after they started building Hrattvekr's walls, it was complete.

## Climate
There are only four months of summer in Oddarsveldi's land. During summer, days can last 7 hours. But when winter comes, days lengthen to 17 hours.

Snow falls during winter. Sometimes, blizzards happen.

## Þuryngard Ring Fortress, Capital of Oddarsveldi
This castle is a large ring fortress made of stone, built on the top of a hill and surrounded by a boreal forest. The castle contains a city made of three towns: Þöllhringr, Kjándallr, and Hrattvekr. The outer wall has a diameter of about 500 meters (~20 hectares). The inner wall is built on higher terrain, which is elevated up about 6 meters.
The inner wall is approximately 100 meters. There are three buildings inside, where the king's house is built at the back, its side facing the main gate, while two smaller ones are built on the side. They are made of stone instead of wood.

The outer wall is much farther from the ring fortress, which fits three towns (or districts). The houses in these districts are made taller and larger, unlike the village houses. These houses did not require additional support beams that were at an angle. The outer walls are about 6 meters high.

In the inner ring, there is a large longhouse built with mostly stone, except for the roof and the top triangular part of the roof. The ring of the castle is generally reserved for only the king, his family, guards, and nobles.

### Þöllhringr, Kjándallr, and Hrattvekr
Þöllhringr is the town of trade. Every day, there are markets and stalls set up on the streets where merchants sell things like common food and items. Kjándallr and Hrattvekr are mostly for living, but Hrattvekr is a little poorer than Kjándallr.

Hrattvekr is known for being the old part of town. The houses in Hrattvekr are somewhat smaller than the ones in Kjándallr, and their tarf roofs are thinner.

### Security
Ten guards patrol the outer ring, ten patrol the towns, and another ten are the king's guards. The king's guards mainly patrol the inner ring. Two guards are also stationed just outside the inner ring's gate, and another two are stationed just inside at the outer ring's gate.

There are also 8 watchtowers with thatched roofs spaced evenly along the outer ring. To get up, there is a ladder at the back of the watchtower, and each tower is stationed one archer with a war horn.

## Social hierarchy
The hierarchy of Oddarsveldi is, from the highest to lowest, king, jarl, hersir, knight, free men, then slave. The hierarchy and social classes are family-based, but if a family is unable to continue its legacy (no other male heirs) or the family's heir abuses their power, the family can lose power in favor of another family.

### King
The king is the highest point of power in Oddarsveldi.

### Jarls
A jarl would live in each ring fortress, and would oversee the ring fortress and their settlements, such as trade or wellbeing, and had power over them to make sure all goes well. A hersir/chieftain would live in each settlement. Jarls can rally troops, enforce laws, build in settlements, or even carry out an execution.

Jarls can assign new hersirs in the settlements they have control over, but both powers, including hersirs, cannot step down themselves and instead must arrange this with a higher authority.

### Hersirs
Hersirs can do things that jarls can, but have a few limitations. Firstly, they are limited to the settlement over which they have power. Secondly, to condemn someone or carry out an execution, the hersir must host a thing where free men who are trusted can attend.

### Knights
Knights are usually warriors who accompany kings, jarls, and hersirs. Each has two knights with them, but the king will always have four. Usually, one of his knights is assigned as vice. When someone with authority dies and he has no son or cousin, one of his knights will become the new heir until a higher authority can find a suitable heir.

### Free men
Free men make up the vast majority of Oddarsveldi's people.

### Slaves
Most slaves are either prisoners of war or convicted criminals serving public service for the king, a jarl, or a hersir. Servants are more of a job, which can take the place of a slave. The advantages servants have over slaves are that they are treated less harshly, they earn money, and their labor isn't forced, meaning they can leave anytime. However, if a slave is found to take the place of a servant, the servant will be dismissed.

## Trade
Oddarsveldi mainly exports iron, wool, and rye. They mostly trade with Heorthland and Centruma. They also export herbs common in the Northern and Southern Northmannish Forests such as ekraldys toadstools, and spices grown in winter.

There is a trade route between Álahringr and Óssvík, where Óssvík supplies Álahringr with fish and Álahringr supplies Óssvík with wood.

## Military
Oddarsveldi has around 2000 men in their army, but most live in their homes.

### Uniforms
Soldiers are required to bring their own weapons. However, royal guards are provided with a coppergate helmet and a maille hauberk, along with a spear.
