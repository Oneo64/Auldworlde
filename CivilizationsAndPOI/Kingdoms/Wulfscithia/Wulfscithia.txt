The Kingdom of Wulfscithia was established in AD 790 by King Wulfblædd as a small kingdom, from explorers who came from Rotherland.

In AD 870, King Wilfriþe passed away. His son inherited the throne from him. But over the next few years, evil fey corrupted the new king and manipulated him, using him as leverage for their crusade against men. Using him, he spread propaganda throughout the kingdom to make his people believe demons possessed other foreigners.

Many, many years later, King Wærmund has taken the throne. Then out of nowhere, Oddarsveldi attacked Wulfscithia. Thus, the Campaign of Wulfscithia had begun.
