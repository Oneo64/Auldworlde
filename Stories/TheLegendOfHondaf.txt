"Now, I shall tell you an old tale, passed from fathers to sons, to travelers alike. And many travelers know this well, so remember this well too, for a day may come that you find yourself at his tomb. And since the truth is lost, I can only tell you what I know, yet to know is better than to not know. So listen carefully:"

"In a time long past, thousands of years ago, there was a town called Namiam in the far south, where the snow doesn't fall, and where men built limestone walls. A man named Hondaf lived in this town. He was strong and had hair of gold, yet he had no fame. Because he was a warrior, he wielded a mace and a war axe."

"Once, a band of earth elementals (or earth-giants, as they called them) attacked Namiam from the western lands. So with his mace and war axe, he boldly leapt onto the first and cleaved it down with his axe. With his mace, he smashed the head off another, and so it was slain and crumbled into dull earth like it was never alive. Then he ducked and dodged a blow, then he spun around and struck another on it's stomach before it could swing again. Yet unfortunately for him, before he could kill them all, they hewed his leg. He fled from them, with only two remaining, and leaving the rest to be killed by the guards."

"For his deeds, the lord of his town saw him worthy of a mace named Star Glising of Namiam. And from that lord he was also given a helmet and a hauberk. Now, he is dead, buried inside his tomb of stone, who his lord requested their builders to make. Until now, his weapons still lay within his tomb, and rumors say that they still shine as if clean, and that his ghost rose to curse his own tomb, and to curse to all who dare enter."
