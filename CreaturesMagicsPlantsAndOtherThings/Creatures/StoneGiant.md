Stone giants are natural manifestations inside of Sotjörðr, and sometimes in the Mountains of Bark.

## Description
Stone giants looks like a hulking humanoid completely made of chunks of stone. Stone giants don't have a face, but they can see normally. Some stone giants may have moss or lichen growing on their bodies.

A stone giant typically stands at a height of almost four meters.


## Abilities
Stone giants cannot speak, but they can understand Wòrdimunag (Primordial). They don't have a natural weapon other than their fists. Because they are a solid material, they are able to pick up weapons and wear armor.
