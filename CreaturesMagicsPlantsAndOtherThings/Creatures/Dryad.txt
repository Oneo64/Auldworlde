Dryads are native to Veldalfheimr. They are bound to their own tree. Then that tree is killed, the dryad becomes chaotic neutral, and will attempt to kill the person who harmed their tree.



[[DESCRIPTION]]
A dryad appears to be a beautiful woman that is completely green. She seems to be naked, however there is thick green mist to cover her private appendages. She radiates green mist from every part of her body.

Dryads mature by 20, and live up to 300 years old.



[[ABILITIES]]
A dryad is able to unlimitedly carve all types of magical staves and perform all druidry. She is also able to control dreams, possess creatures, and willingly travel from Veldalfheimr to Myrkjörðr and vice versa. She will always know the location of her tree, unless it is destroyed.

Dryads are able to speak Druidic and Sylvan.
