A draugr (Oddarish plural: *draugar*, Heorthlandic: *drog*, Icelandic: *draugur*) is a revenant who comes alive. Many draugar come to be because they were cursed, but some may rise because they weren't buried properly. One way to prevent their rise is to ensure they are laying down, and their hands and feet are bound together. Most draugar come to be in the northern lands of Myrkjörðr.

## Description
Some draugar might look like they're covered in ash, with grey skin, completely white eyes, and sparse grey hair. Some might be bloated at their stomach and completely black as if they were burnt. But whatever appearance they may have, they will always seem like a walking corpse.

When a draugr is in their burial place, they will remain "dead" undisturbed. But if one disturbs their tomb, whether it is to touch any of their belongings or the draugr itself, the draugr will rise and protect its belongings. If a draugr comes to be, but it wasn't buried in a tomb, it will simply rise and haunt the living.

Even though draugar can speak, they don't use it to talk to others. Instead, they mostly use their voice to chant incantations. 

## Draugric powers
Despite being undead, draugar can move as if they were alive, albeit with a little stagger. They are twice as strong compared to men, can see in the dark, and can't be poisoned or exorcised. To kill a draugr, their head must be decapitated or removed.

Most draugar possess two unique abilities. Some draugar, like Joki's description of them, had the ability to vanish into the air and appear elsewhere. Others could turn their heads a full circle around, or enter the dreams of other people. Some were said to practice seiðr and curse anyone who tried to enter their domain.

Draugar can still speak, but their voice sounds raspy and deep. Since most draugr are more than a hundred years old, they might speak an ancient language no one understands.
