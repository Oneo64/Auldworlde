# Gvarth

A gvarth (Oddarish: *gvar√∞r*) is a sentient tree created from normal living trees by evil fey as soldiers.

## Description
A gvarth is a towering tree the size of an oak, and is indistinguishable from normal trees. Some gvarths are adorned with dark green banners or carved with sylvan and druidic runes.

## Abilities
Gvarths move by having their roots move in the dirt like the oars of a boat. Their branches are like boneless arms or whips, and can lash out with the force of a mace. They rely on sensing their targets instead of seeing them, which means they can "see" in the dark.

These things can't move on hard surfaces like stone, but they can leap into the air with five times the force of a man. They're aware that if they aren't careful when they jump, they might harm themselves, but other than that, they aren't wise or smart, nor do they have free will. They can't speak, but understand Druidic and Sylvan.
