Algord is an ex-soldier who lives in Álahringr. He has four sons, Ulfnir, Ljörn, and Alfrir, and one daughter, Yngvild.



[[APPEARANCE]]
Algord has brown eyes, fair skin, and wavy shoulder-length blond hair (which is starting to grey), with a full beard.

He wears a long muted red tunic with brown accents, a ring belt, brown baggy pants, and a pair of boots. He also wears an iron Talmundúr amulet, a plain bronze circlet, and two bronze rings one on each middle finger. On his belt, he has a seax sheathed in its case. He is 175 centimeters tall (5'9").

He has a scar on his lower right rib, caused by a longaxe while defending his house.

He is currently married to Mifrún.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Algord is distrustful of other people not related to his family, with certain exceptions such as a close friend. He dislikes centaurs especially due to a centaur raid that happened a few years ago. He would use strong language to express his frustration.



[[ABILITIES]]
Even though Algord only had a few days training with an axe and shield, he has experience fighting bandits from a one-year military campaign, and some from defending his home from the raid. He can also play Rægatafl, but he only plays it with his family members. The only language he understands is Fjallandic.
