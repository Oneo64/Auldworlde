[[DESCRIPTION]]
Rúna is a woodcarver who carves small things for her father to sell at the local marketplace. She is slim and curvaceous, and her height is 5'4". She has long, armpit-length, light brown hair that is wavy and flows freely. Her almond eyes are large and pale green, and her skin is pale with a slight reddish hue, with soft freckles scattered across her face.

When she is outside, she tends to wear a dark yellow woolen cloak with a slightly frayed edge, held by a bronze double brooch with a chain. She casually wears a simple, muted blue calf-length tunic, a braided leather ring belt, and leather shoes. On her belt, there is a small sheathed seax for defense. She wears a necklace with an iron Talmundúr amulet. She owns a short spear (with a sling), which she carries only when she goes into the forest.

Rúna is friends Yngvild, who she met from childhood. She can usually be found in her home making wood carvings, and would sometimes would accompany Ljörn into the forest to explore and collect herbs.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Rúna is slightly introverted, yet friendly. She is bashful, easily flustered, and sometimes averts her eyes when talking to people she doesn't know well. But despite these traits, she isn't shy.

Rúna has a small degree of perfectionism. However, her perfectionism isn't the "everything must be tidy" way. It's when she sometimes worries if she's done anything wrong almost immediately after she does something. Sometimes when not doing anything or listening to someone talk, Rúna would space out and start wondering about random things.

When Rúna is with Ljörn, she becomes more bashful due to her inexperience, but she is still willing to stay for a prolonged period. She is kinder, of course, and even though she finds his occasional stubbornness a little difficult, she works around it. She feels a small protectiveness over Ljörn (gained after she saw Ljörn injured by an arrow), but she would never admit it aloud. Ljörn is, besides her family members, one of the only people she would gift her crafts to without expecting anything in return.

Rúna's favorite food is roasted potatoes, especially salted ones. When she's nervous, she fidgets with the hem of her clothing.



[[ABILITIES]]
[Arts and Crafts]
Since Rúna is a woodcarver, she can carve small things such as spoons and animal figurines. She can play the lyre, however, she isn't brave enough to play it in the presence of strangers. She is also a herbalist and can identify many common herbs that grow in the north.

[Physicality]
Even though Rúna has a spear, she can't use it well. She only knows how to thrust or hold something down once the spearhead gets in, mainly for defense against wild animals.

[Language]
Rúna is fluent in Fjallandic since that's her native language. She has a minor understanding of Rotherlandic and can speak it if she reads from a script or practices a sentence. She can also read and write them in Fjallandic Runes.
