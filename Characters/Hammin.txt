Hammin is one of Randúlfr's knights. He earned the title "the Angelic" because his appearance, light-blond and pale skin, makes him look very pale like an angel.

Hammin's hair is short light-blond and curly, his eyes are pale green, and has fair skin. He also has a light stubble for a beard.

He wears a tan cloak, a yellow tunic, dark grey pants, a ring belt, and a pair of shoes. He wears a iron Talmundúr amulet, and an iron arm ring. He also sports a spear, and a round shield slung on his back. His round shield is painted white and blue.



[[PERSONALITY]]
As a knight, Hammin is loyal to Randúlfr as in honor. He is also an extrovert, as he likes to talk and usually acts as a front for Randúlfr. Hammin would act caring to people he sees as vulnerable, especially physically. However he doesn't like centaurs, and may jump to conclusions without much thought.



[[ABILITIES]]
Hammin speaks Oddarish as his native language. He can also speak some Heorthlandic even though it isn't fluent. He practices combat with a sword and shield, and knows how to ride horses. He can also play the board game Rægatafl.
