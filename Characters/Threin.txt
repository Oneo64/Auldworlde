[[DESCRIPTION]]
Þrein is a human from Lismerlaf. He has grey eyes, pale skin, and short light brown hair. His face has a minimal amount of freckles, and his skin is slightly wrinkled.

Þrein wears a brown triangular fur cap, a muted aqua (blueish green) tunic with brown accents, baggy brown pants, a belt, and a pair of boots. He has a 12-inch seax sheathed on his belt, and a coin purse. He wears an iron Talmundúr amulet.

Þrein is the father of Ennu and Baulnir. Þrein also works as a fish trader, and owns a karve. He trades along the Argánlaf-Lismerlaf route, and Baulnir usually goes with him.

He is currently married to Þrunna.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Þrein is described as having a good heart, and is protective of his family. He also has a keen eyesight from hunting experience. However he may be somewhat impulsive, and paranoid of his own ship being stolen by thieves.

Þrein speaks Centrumic (English) weirdly. Not only does he have a strong Fjallandic accent, but he speaks Centrumic using the grammar of his native tongue.



[[ABILITIES]]
Þrein is a trader, who owns a karve and knows how to control that boat. Because of his occupation as a trader, he is able to speak both Fjallandic and Centrumic (English). Because he hunts deer for sport and food when there's no fish to trade, he's good with a longbow.
