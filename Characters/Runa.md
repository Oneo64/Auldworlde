Rúna is a woodcarver who carves small things for her father to sell at the local marketplace. Rúna is friends with Yngvild, whom she has met since childhood.

Rúna can usually be found in her home making wood carvings, and would sometimes accompany Ljörn into the forest to explore and collect herbs.

## Appearance
Rúna has long, armpit-length, light brown hair that is wavy and flows freely. Her almond eyes are large and pale green, and her skin is pale with a slight reddish hue, with soft freckles scattered across her face. She is slim and curvaceous, and her height is 5'4".

When she is outside, she tends to wear a dark yellow woolen cloak with a slightly frayed edge, held by a bronze double brooch with a chain. She casually wears a simple, muted blue calf-length tunic, a braided leather ring belt, and leather shoes. On her belt, there is a small sheathed seax for defense. She wears a necklace with an iron Talmundúr amulet. She owns a short spear (with a sling), which she carries only when she goes into the forest.

## Personality
Rúna is slightly introverted. She is bashful, easily flustered, and sometimes averts her eyes when talking to people she doesn't know well. But despite these traits, she isn't shy.

Rúna has a small degree of perfectionism. However, her perfectionism isn't the "everything must be tidy" way. It's when she sometimes worries if she's done anything wrong, almost immediately after she does something.[^1]

Sometimes, when not doing anything or listening to someone talk, Rúna would space out and start wondering about random things.

Rúna's favorite food is roasted potatoes, especially those with salt. When she's nervous, she fidgets with the hem of her clothing.

Rúna knows about Ljörn's paranoia.

### Secret
Sometime in the past, when Dagnir was playing a jest on Rúna, he showed her a piece of paper on how to draw Veldismagn. Rúna felt uncomfortable by how it was made, but she still hadn't forgotten it. Despite feeling uncomfortable, sometimes, she would use pig blood to draw them for protection.

## Abilities
### Arts and Crafts
Since Rúna is a woodcarver, she can carve small things such as spoons and animal figurines.

### Herbalism
Rúna is a herbalist and can identify many common herbs that grow in the north.

### Lyre
Rúna can play the lyre; however, she isn't brave enough to play it in the presence of strangers. 

### Physicality
Even though Rúna has a spear, she can't use it well. She only knows how to thrust or hold something down once the spearhead gets in, mainly for defense against wild animals.

### Language
Rúna is only fluent in Oddarish, as it's her native language. She has a minor understanding of Heorthlandic and can speak it if she reads from a script or practices a sentence. She can also read and write them in Oddarish runes.

### Veldismagn
Rúna knows how to draw Veldismagn.

## Goal
"Ek vil at gera égvafus selingkónu. Ænn ek... ek vot eigi hvótasl."

*Translation: "I want to be a successful merchant. Yet I... I don't know how."*

## Notes
[^1]: The first time Njall decided to sell one of Rúna's carvings, the buyer returned it and complained that it wasn't worth anything because it wasn't symmetrical.
