[[DESCRIPTION]]
Áleifr is the firstborn prince of Oddarsveldi, son of King Alfþórr II. He is a strikingly handsome young man, with a lean build and taller than average as he stands at 5' 11". His long wavy brown hair reaches to his armpits, blue eyes, and fair skin.

He wears a frayed brown cloak, a vibrant red tunic embroidered with a brown pattern, blue pants, a braided leather ring belt, and a pair of leather boots. He has a baldric with a Viking sword.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Áleifr is brave, and courageous, with a proud view of his father's kingdom. He's also quite polite, but the politeness is more of a nobility/royalty thing rather than out of pure kindness.



[[ABILITIES]]
Áleifr can speak Northmannish and Heorthlandic. Áleifr's skill with the sword is above the average fighter, as he has trained with some of Þuryngard's best warriors.
