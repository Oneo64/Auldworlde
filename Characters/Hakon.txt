During combat or traveling, he carries a coppergate helmet, and a round shield slung across his shoulders, painted red with a blue valknut on it.

[[PERSONALITY]]
Hákon has a strong sense of honor, loyal to Fjalland and his position as jarl of Kjartkofn. He is described as bold and dominating, willing to assert control over anything he sees as disorganized.



[[ABILITIES]]
Hákon speaks Fjallandic as his native language. As the jarl, Hákon learned Heorthlandic to communicate with foreigners.

Hákon practices sword fighting and is able to hold his own in against two average fighters with the same weaponry. Because his sword is usually coared in the magic grease, each strike of his sword burns whatever he slashes with a puff of flame.

Sometimes when he isn't practicing with his sword, he practices riding a horse inside his fortress.



[[LORE]]
In AD 961 during one of Fjalland's campaigns, because of his skill, armor, and weaponry, he was chosen to lead a group to go along the northern side of the river next to Óssvík and Álahringr. They had 40 men to go along that river to go down south.

They destroyed only one bandit camp. During raid, Hákon met Mod, who was a mercenary hired to go along this campaign. They became acquainted as war buddies, after playing a race to see how many bandits they could kill.

In AD 966 when Okrif, the current Jarl of Kjartkjofn died, Hákon was given the new position as jarl.

Just recently, Okrif's son's son went to the jarl demanding that he should be the current jarl. Hákon then got two guards to seize the son's son, let him off with a warning before having him be escorted out of the fortress. To the people living in villages under his domain, he is usually feared, but not as much as the king.
