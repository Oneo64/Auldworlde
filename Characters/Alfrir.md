Alfrir is an explorer from Álahringr.

## Appearance
Alfrir has fair skin which is slightly tanned, dark blue eyes, brown hair that goes all the way down to his armpits, and a stubble.

He wears a blue woolen cap with green accents, dark blue shawl, a maille hauberk, a dark green tunic, and a pair of brown pants. He has a pouch and a bearded axe on his belt, a 12 inch long seax, and he wears boots on his feet. He wears an iron Talmundúr amulet. He is 5'8" centimeters tall.

He wears a maille-less Gjermundbu helmet in combat. He has a spear, and a white round shield with a black symbol (Helm of Awe) painted on it.

## Personality
Alfrir can be described as a competitive warrior. He is also impulsive, sometimes not thinking before acting out. He is also mindful of his surroundings, and is careful not to knock anything over or do anything clumsy. However, he can show cowardice to the unknown, to people with much more fighting power, or people with greater political power.

Alfrir has a subtle sense of humor, yet his sense of humor only shows during hard times.

### Voice
"Ljörn, think about it! We could become-"
"Hey. Are you still thinking about Álahringr?"
"I told you this land would be prosperous. And they're going to Fjörðvík, father is. The war won't touch them there. You need not worry about them."
"The explorers took three days, I heard."

## Abilities
### Physicality
Alfrir has combat experience from raiding a castle ruins, fighting against couple of draugar. This raiding was with his brother Ljörn, and three other people (Baulnir, Elkfriða, and Sága).

He has six years worth of spear fighting practice, and makes him above average in combat with his spear. He usually likes to fight safely by keeping a distance with his shield in front of him, waiting for an opening to strike.

### Language
Alfrir can only speak Oddarish. Sometimes he can pick up small hints from a Centrumic conversation due to familiarity and similarly, but can also lead to misunderstanding.

### Rægatafl
Alfrir knows how to play Rægatafl.
