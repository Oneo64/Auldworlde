Algord is an ex-soldier who lives in Álahringr. He has four sons, Ulfnir, Ljörn, and Alfrir, and one daughter, Yngvild.

## Appearance
Algord has brown eyes, fair skin, and wavy shoulder-length blond hair (which is starting to grey), with a full beard.

He wears a long muted red tunic with brown accents, a ring belt, brown baggy pants, and a pair of boots. He also wears an iron Talmundúr amulet, a plain bronze circlet, and two bronze rings, one on each middle finger. On his belt, he has a seax sheathed in its case. He is 5'9" tall.

He has a scar on his lower right rib, caused by a longaxe while defending his house.[^1]

## Personality
Algord is distrustful of other people not related to his family, with certain exceptions such as a close friend. He dislikes centaurs especially due to a centaur raid that happened a few years ago. He would use strong language to express his frustration.

## Abilities
### Physicality
As a soldier, Algord only had a few days of training with an axe and shield. Later, he gained real experience fighting bandits from a one-year military campaign, and some from defending his home from the raid. 

### Language
Algord speaks Oddarish.

### Rægatafl
Algord can play Rægatafl, but he only plays it with his family members.

## Notes
[^1]: During the centaur raid, despite Mifrún's pleading, Algord didn't go to the designated shelter and stayed at their house to protect their belongings. But while Algord stayed behind with Ulfnir, a centaur broke down their door and hit him with a longaxe. Ulfnir killed the centaur, then went to help him.
