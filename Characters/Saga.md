Sága is an explorer from Álahringr.

## Appearance
Sága has shoulder-length curly black hair and fair skin. Her eyes are captivatingly green, and her right eye is slightly browner than her left. Her eyebrows are thinner, and her ears are slightly pointed. She is 5'4" tall.

Sága casually wears a dark red tunic, brown pants, a ring belt, and a pair of shoes. She wears a necklace of a strange-looking pebble she found near the river.

When Sága is outside, she wears a dark brown cloak with double brooches. When Sága is training or traveling, she carries her nasal helmet, kite shield, and baldric scabbard.

## Personality
Sága, like her father, is adventurous and curious. Normally, Sága wouldn't strike up conversation as fast and as eagerly as an extrovert would, but once she gets into a conversation, especially small talk, she becomes very talkative.

Sága likes to tell stories, especially heroic sagas (hence her name) that she's read. When asked, her favorite types of sagas are those where the protagonist goes on a journey and experiences the wonders and horrors of the world outside of his home village.

Sometimes, Sága tries to be independent to prove her worth, even if whatever she's going to do would be considered reckless by many.

Sága sees Seyja as a role model and aspires to be as brave as her.
