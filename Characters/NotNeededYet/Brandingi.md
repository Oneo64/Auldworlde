Brandingi is one of the patrolling guards in Álahringr.

## Appearance
Brandingi's hair is dark blond and wavy, his eyes are dark brown, and has lightly tanned skin. He has a sharp jawline, and he has his right ear cut off and a scar on his right shoulder caused by a sword.

He wears a dark blue cloak, a muted green tunic, grey pants, a ring belt, and a pair of shoes. He has a sheathed seax on his belt. He wears a iron Talmundúr amulet.

When patrolling, he wears a leather nasal helmet and carries around a spear.

## Personality
Brandingi is protective and will go as far as being late for dinner to patrol around another five minutes. He wants to prove that he is capable in combat, and takes pride in himself when he kills something that isn't very threatening, such as a zombie. However, he is somewhat sensitive to criticism, especially destructive criticism, even if it is said as a joke.

In reality, the reason why he's so eager to prove himself is that both of his brothers became Randúlfr's knights, while he's a village patroller.

## Abilities
### Physicality
Brandingi has skill in his spear, but he has more skill when he's in a shield wall formation with at least another person.
