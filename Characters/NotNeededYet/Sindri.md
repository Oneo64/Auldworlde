Sindri hair is shoulder-length blond and wavy, his eyes are dark brown, and has fair skin. His left arm is missing, severed by an atgeir during a centaur raid.

He wears a brown woolen cap, brown cloak, a maille hauberk, a muted yellow tunic, brown pants, a ring belt, and a pair of shoes. He wears a iron Talmundúr amulet, and an iron arm ring. He also sports a baldric scabbard with a viking sword sheathed inside. 

## Personality
