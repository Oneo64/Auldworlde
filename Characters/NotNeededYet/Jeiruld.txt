[[PERSONALITY]]
Jeiruld is described as observant and analytical, being able to spot any hint of deception and make out the true intentions of people faster than anyone. He is also mysterious and aloof, careful not to let some information about him slip, such as his age or how powerful he really is. He may also come of as being easily angered from clumsiness, ignorance, or disrespect due the reason of being old.

He harbors one secret, one that no one knows, which is the fact that he is able to cast the necromantic spell Raise Zombie.



[[ABILITIES]]
Being a scholar and a powerful sorcerer, Jeiruld can speak many languages alongside Centrumic (English). He studied Rotherlandic and Taribian so he could communicate with people from the north and south. And lastly he learned Abyssal so he could study demons.

Jeiruld is very intelligent and wise, knowing many spells, ancient items, and history that goes back over two thousand years. He also knows about every realm in the world.

He also has some combat experience, gained from a mission thirty years ago when he and two others were sent to kill three earth elementals.
