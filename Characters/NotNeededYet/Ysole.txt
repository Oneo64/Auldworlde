[[DESCRIPTION]]
Ysole has green eyes, pale skin, and long light blonde hair. She wears a purple surcoat bearing Ljúnandr's symbol (which is a four pointed star), a grey tunic, brown pants, a buckled belt, and a pair of boots. She is 165 (5'5) centimeters tall.

She wears a metal helmet with a brass rim in combat. She carries a spatha in a blue scabbard, and a blue Norman kite shield slung across her back.

Her goal is to protect the world and the cycle of life from undeath, and is willing to kill any undead she sees. During the day when she isn't exploring or going on a "crusade", she can be found either patrolling the streets, talking to people in the community center, or riding her horse in the nearby woods.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Ysole is generous and has that kind of dutiful, righteous act. She is meddlesome, as she likes to assert or associate herself with things she doesn't need to be involved with. She is also a purist, and never participates or even support any kind of war against another civilization.



[[ABILITIES]]
Ysole speaks Audeveaurian as her mother tongue, and learned Centrumic (English). She has only little experience with her sword and shield, gained from defending her town from a small group of bonemen with the help of the town's guards. Because Ysole is a seeress, she would also practice seiðr.
