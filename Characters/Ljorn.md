Ljörn is a warrior who sometimes utilizes galdrastafir.

When at work, Ljörn can be found at his house chopping firewood, checking his family's farm for weeds, or helping Alfrir and Ulfnir carry wood they felled back to their home. In his free time, he would play Plattrægnall with someone (mostly with Alfrir), or go into the forest to explore. 

## Appearance
Ljörn is a warrior who sometimes utilizes galdrastafir. He stands at 5'9" and has an average build for a warrior. His long, dark blond hair has gentle but messy waves and is a little longer than shoulder length. He has a light stubble and fair skin. Often, his hair is pulled back and then secured by a cloth strip that he ties around his head. His eyes are hooded, downturned, and dark pale blue, making him seem sad or tired to many people.

### Casual wear
When Ljörn is outside, he dons a woolen brown cloak to keep himself warm and dry. Casually, he wears a muted blue tunic, brown pants, a belt, and leather boots. He has a baldric carrying a scabbard with a sword.[^1] On his belt, he has a leather pouch and a small seax under the sword baldric. Ljörn wears a necklace of an iron Talmundúr amulet.

### Traveling
When he travels or prepares for combat, Ljörn puts on a nasal helmet and his byrnie, and he equips himself with his spear and round shield. He will also carry a tiny grimoire (about fifteen pages) and a piece of coal in the pouch.

## Personality
Ljörn is reserved and slightly introverted. He doesn't speak much and prefers quiet and solitary areas, but he doesn't mind public spaces (or even crowded places). When he talks to strangers, he might make things awkward, but otherwise, he tries to be polite, especially to his elders or higher-ups. He is stubborn; he usually won't change his mind after making a decision.

To strangers, unless he is interacting with them, Ljörn acts uncaring and unassertive since he usually doesn't involve himself in things that don't concern him. For example, if a thief stole something from someone he doesn't know, he'll ignore the commotion.

When Ljörn gets frustrated, he quietly uses strong language under his breath, but he doesn't use extreme insults or belittling.

Ljörn's favorite food is venison. He keeps a small bag of dried strips in his pouch for later. For some reason, his second favorite food is dried, hard bread with the crust. He says it's because it's chewy.

### Paranoia
Ljörn has paranoia. He seems fine most of the time, but sometimes, it shows. He gets anxious when he's inside dark forests. If he sees corpses that look like they might wake up, he would freak out and leave the scene. He would avoid reading the story *Draugritt um minn Výss*, or any stories with undead in them. When looking at old weapons, especially rusted/deteriorated polearms, he would start breathing heavily.[^2]

Sometimes out of nowhere, Ljörn gets reminded of his experience with Ingwaz and becomes paranoid, thinking Ingwaz might still be searching for him. He only calms down if he forgets about it. He will also calm down if he knows he's near a bundle of juniper needles[^3], but he'll still be thinking about it.

If confronted about his behavior, even if it were Rúna (who knows about his paranoia), Ljörn would either try to dismiss it or not answer at all. Even though Alfrir only noticed his behaviour once, Ljörn told him not to worry about it.

### Rúna
Ljörn visits Rúna once every day; he finds that when Rúna is there, he can relax a little despite his paranoia.

## Abilities
### Physicality
Ljörn fights with a spear and shield, and his combat abilities with weapons are slightly above average. He knows Glíma and learned how to do basic blocks, strikes, and disarms. He has combat experience from a previous adventure in the ruins of an old castle, where he fought a couple of draugar. He also has a good survival instinct, which was shown during Ingwaz's attack.

Because Ljörn was shot in the shoulder with an arrow during a centaur raid, his left arm was weakened.

### Galdrastafir
Ljörn has access to magical staves because of his grimoire. He usually has the grimoire open while he draws a stave because he doesn't bother to memorize them. He doesn't draw staves during combat for obvious reasons.

**Galdrastafir**

 - Ægishjálmur
 - Gapaldur
 - Lesser Hagall
 - Repel Demons
 - Tóustefna
 - Vegvísir

### Language
Ljörn's native language is Oddarish, but he can also speak Heorthlandic and Centrumic (English).

Ljörn is very bad at Centrumic. Somehow, he always reverts to using Oddarish grammar. When he tries to pronounce *w*, he ends up pronouncing *hw* or *v*. When Ljörn tries to pronounce *sh*, he ends up pronouncing *s* or *sk*. When he pronounces *d*, he sometimes ends up pronouncing *ð*. Sometimes, it's not just a pronunciation problem. He would say *já/ná* for *yes/no*, *ik/mik* for *I*, *mine* for *my*, *thu/theu* for *you*, *thine* for *your*, *thes* for *this*, *that* for *it*, *i'* for *in*, *skall* for *shall/must*, *skould* for *should*, etc.

### Rægatafl
Ljörn knows how to play Rægatafl, a local board game.

## Examples of Ljörn's speech and reactions
**Average interaction with a merchant:**

 - **Merchant:** "Fine day, isn’t it? Haven’t seen you around. Looking for anything special?"
 - **Ljörn:** "Já. Ik finds hwetstone."
 - **Merchant:** "What did you say?"
 - **Ljörn:** "Hwetstone."
 - **Merchant:** "You mean whetstone? That will be two silvers."
 - **Ljörn hands the merchant two silver coins.**
 - **Ljörn:** "Here."
 - **The merchant takes the silver, and gives him a whetstone.**
 - **Ljörn:** "Sakka þik." *Sakka þik means "thank you" in Oddarish.*
 - **Merchant:** "What will you be using it for?"
 - **Ljörn:** "That are for mine sworð."
 - **The merchant nods.**
 - **Merchant:** "Good day to you then."
 - **Ljörn nods in return and leaves with the whetstone.**

**Average reaction when seeing a rusty polearm:**

 - *Ljörn is wandering around Álahringr's streets when he passes by a house. There is an old Dane axe resting against the house walls. He glances at it. He stops breathing for a moment, and his heart rate goes up. He swears under his breath before quickly leaving the scene.*

**A rare case when Ljörn "admits" his paranoia:**

 - **During a visit with Rúna, Ljörn found himself breathing heavily as he stared into the forest.**
 - **Rúna:** "Ljörn?"
 - **Ljörn doesn't respond.**
 - **Rúna:** "Ljörn."
 - **Ljörn suddenly becomes aware of what he's doing.**
 - **Ljörn:** "Já?" *Yes?*
 - **Rúna:** "Þú var avíu sam það. Artú koðr?" *You're doing it again. Are you okay?*
 - **Ljörn:** "Ek... ek ött svá summ þíng í skungritt." *I... I just saw something in the forest.*
 - **Rúna looks into the forest, expecting to see something. But she doesn't.**
 - **Ljörn:** "Ybbask eigi." *Don't worry.*

## Notes
[^1]: Ljörn's sword is a Peterson Type L sword.
[^2]: Before his adventure, Ljörn knew the story told in *Draugritt um minn Výss*. One of the characters, Yngvarr, was killed by a draugr when he was knocked over and slashed. And during his trip to the castle ruin, Ljörn was knocked over and was almost killed by Ingwaz the Fiend, just like how Yngvarr was in the story. Then, when he and his accomplices fled, Ingwaz chased them. Ljörn only thought they lost the draugr when they camped in the forest, and it was quiet. That moment is where his odd behaviors come from.
[^3]: Juniper is a type of greater protection herb.
