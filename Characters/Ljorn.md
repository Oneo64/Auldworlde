Ljörn is a warrior who sometimes utilizes galdrastafir.

When at work, Ljörn chops firewood, checks his family's farm for weeds, or helps Alfrir and Ulfnir carry wood back home. In his free time, he plays Rægatafl with someone (mostly with Alfrir), goes into the forest to explore, or visits Rúna.

## Appearance
Ljörn has shoulder-length, dark blond hair with gentle but messy waves. His hair is pulled back and then secured by a cloth strip tied around his head. He has a light stubble and fair skin. His eyes are hooded, downturned, and dark pale blue, making him seem sad or tired to many people. He stands at 5'9" and has an average build for a warrior.

### Casual wear
When Ljörn is outside, he dons a woolen brown cloak to keep himself warm and dry. Casually, he wears a muted blue tunic, brown pants, a belt, and leather boots. He wears a baldric scabbard with a sword.[^1] He has a leather pouch and a small seax on his belt. Ljörn wears a necklace of an iron Talmundúr amulet.

### Traveling
When he travels or prepares for combat, Ljörn puts on a nasal helmet and his byrnie, and he equips himself with his spear and round shield. He will also carry a tiny grimoire (about fifteen pages) and a piece of coal in the pouch.

## Personality
Ljörn is reserved and slightly introverted. He does not speak much and prefers quiet and solitary areas, although he doesn't mind being in public (or crowded places). When he talks to strangers, he might make things awkward, but otherwise, he tries to be polite, especially to his elders or higher-ups. He is stubborn; he usually sticks to his decisions.

To strangers, Ljörn acts uncaring and unassertive, ignoring things that don't concern him. For example, if a thief stole something from someone he doesn't know, he'll ignore the commotion.

When Ljörn gets frustrated, he quietly uses strong language under his breath, but he avoids using extreme insults or belittling.

Ljörn's favorite food is venison. He keeps a small bag of dried strips in his pouch for later. His second favorite food is dried, hard bread with the crust because it's chewy.

### Paranoia
Ljörn has paranoia. He seems fine most of the time, but sometimes, it shows. He gets anxious when he's inside dark forests. If he sees corpses that look like they might wake up, he would freak out and leave the scene. He avoids reading the story *Draugritt um minn Výss*, or any stories with undead in them. When looking at old weapons, especially rusted/deteriorated polearms, he would start breathing heavily.[^2]

Occasionally, Ljörn is reminded of his experience with Ingwaz and becomes paranoid, thinking Ingwaz might still be searching for him. He only calms down by forgetting it or knowing he's near a bundle of juniper needles[^3], though the thought still lingers.

If confronted about his behavior, Ljörn would either try to dismiss it or not answer at all. Although Alfrir noticed his behavior only once, Ljörn told him not to worry.

### Rúna
Ljörn visits Rúna once every day; he finds that when Rúna is there, he can relax a little despite his paranoia.

### Goals
Ljörn wants to protect his family, and especially Rúna. He also wants to gain wealth. But sometimes his paranoia takes over, compelling him to avoid the trigger.

## Abilities
### Physicality
Ljörn fights with a spear and shield, and his combat abilities with weapons are slightly above average. He knows Glíma and learned how to do basic blocks, strikes, and disarms. He has combat experience from a previous adventure in the ruins of an old castle, where he fought a couple of draugar. He also has a good survival instinct, which was shown during Ingwaz's attack.

Because Ljörn was shot in the shoulder with an arrow during a centaur raid, his left arm was weakened.

### Galdrastafir
Ljörn has access to magical staves because of his grimoire. He usually has the grimoire open while he draws a stave because he doesn't bother to memorize them. He doesn't draw staves during combat for obvious reasons.

**Galdrastafir**

 - Ægishjálmur
 - Gapaldur
 - Lesser Hagall
 - Repel Demons
 - Tóustefna
 - Vegvísir

### Language
Ljörn's native language is Oddarish, but he can also speak Heorthlandic and Centrumic (English).

Ljörn is very bad at Centrumic. Somehow, he always reverts to using Oddarish grammar. When he tries to pronounce *w*, he ends up pronouncing *hw* or *v*. When Ljörn tries to pronounce *sh*, he ends up pronouncing *s* or *sk*. When he pronounces *d*, he sometimes ends up pronouncing *ð*. Sometimes, it's not just a pronunciation problem. He would say *já/ná* for *yes/no*, *ik/mik* for *I*, *mine* for *my*, *thu/theu* for *you*, *thine* for *your*, *thes* for *this*, *that* for *it*, *i'* for *in*, *skall* for *shall/must*, *skould* for *should*, etc.

### Rægatafl
Ljörn knows how to play Rægatafl, a local board game.

## Examples of Ljörn's speech and reactions
**Average interaction with a merchant:**

 - **Merchant:** "Fine day, isn’t it? Haven’t seen you around. Looking for anything special?"
 - **Ljörn:** "Já. Ik finds hwetstone."
 - **Merchant:** "What did you say?"
 - **Ljörn:** "Hwetstone."
 - **Merchant:** "You mean whetstone? That will be two silvers."
 - **Ljörn hands the merchant two silver coins.**
 - **Ljörn:** "Here."
 - **The merchant takes the silver, and gives him a whetstone.**
 - **Ljörn:** "Sakka þik." *Sakka þik means "thank you" in Oddarish.*
 - **Merchant:** "What will you be using it for?"
 - **Ljörn:** "That are for mine sworð."
 - **The merchant nods.**
 - **Merchant:** "Good day to you then."
 - **Ljörn nods in return and leaves with the whetstone.**

**Average reaction when seeing a rusty polearm:**

 - *Ljörn is wandering around Álahringr's streets when he passes by a house. There is an old Dane axe resting against the house walls. He glances at it. He stops breathing for a moment, and his heart rate goes up. He swears under his breath before quickly leaving the scene.*

**A rare case when Ljörn "admits" his paranoia:**

 - **During a visit to Rúna's home, Ljörn and Rúna are both in the yard. Ljörn's eyes catch something within the forest, and he soon finds himself breathing heavily as he stares at it.**
 - **Rúna:** "Ljörn?"
 - **Ljörn doesn't respond. He doesn't seem to hear her.**
 - **Rúna sharpens her voice a little.**
 - **Rúna:** "Ljörn."
 - **Ljörn suddenly becomes aware of what he's doing. He tears his gaze away from the forest and looks at Rúna. He speaks as if nothing happened.**
 - **Ljörn:** "Já?" *(Yes?)*
 - **Rúna's voice is soft again.**
 - **Rúna:** "Þú var avíu sam það. Artú koðr?" *(You're doing it again. Are you okay?)*
 - **Ljörn:** "Ek... svá summ þíng í skungritt. Það var eigeinn." *(I... saw something in the forest. It's nothing.)*
 - **Rúna looks into the forest, expecting to see something. But she doesn't.**
 - **Ljörn:** "Ybbask eigi." *(Don't worry.)*
 - **Rúna:** "Þóse, séga mik. Ar... þær sleikandi þik?" *(Please, tell me. Is... there something bothering you?)*
 - **Ljörn:** "Ná." *(No.)*

## Notes
[^1]: Ljörn's sword is a Peterson Type L sword.
[^2]: Before his adventure, Ljörn knew the story told in *Draugritt um minn Výss*. Yngvarr, a character in the story, died when a draugr knocked him over and slashed him. During Ljörn's trip to the castle ruin, Ingwaz knocked him over (like Yngvarr) and almost killed him. When he and his accomplices fled, Ingwaz chased them. Ljörn only thought they lost the draugr when he heard the forest was quiet during their camp for the night. That moment is where his odd behaviors come from.
[^3]: Juniper is a type of greater protection herb.
