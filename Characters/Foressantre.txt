[[DESCRIPTION]]
Föressantre is a dryad. A dryad appears to be a beautiful woman that is completely green. She seems to be naked, however there is thick green mist to cover her private appendages. She radiates green mist from every part of her body.

Föressantre has long hair that reaches her shoulder blades, with a few locks of hair covering her left eye that was blinded by a troll attack. Her right eye is upturned, while her left eye remains closed with a scar across it.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Föressantre is a dryad who doesn't like being near many people. When she is with someone who isn't a fey or moon elf, she gets timid. She also has a bitterness directed at trolls, and a fear of fire.



[[ABILITIES]]
She can speak Druidic and Sylvan as a native language. Being a druid, she can use all druidry magic and carve all magical staves. She can also control dreams, possess creatures, and willingly travel from Veldalfheimr to Myrkjorðr and vice versa.



[[LORE]]
[AD 952]
After a group of trolls mistook Föressantre for a ghost made of poison, they burned her tree down with fire. Föressantre tracked the trolls back to their camp and tried to take revenge, but was attacked and got her left eye blinded. Luckily, a dwarven seer-druid distracted the tribe from Föressantre. She made her escape, and vowed to never go back again.

[AD 953]
Föressantre set up a small wooden house for herself in the middle of nowhere of the Northern Northmannish Forest. A few weeks later, she inadvertently attracted a couple of faerie hares to her settlement. She decided to take care of these faerie hares.

[AD 954]
Föressantre planted a tree right in front of her house. This tree would become her personal tree, even though it isn't bound to her.
