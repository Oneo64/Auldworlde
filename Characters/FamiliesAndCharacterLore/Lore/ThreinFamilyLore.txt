[Year 971]
(July)
A group of bandits from the south raided Óssvík, there were around 30 of them. Baulnir helped defend the village, killing two bandits.

While this was happening, three bandits tried to steal Þrein's boat. They were able to sail it 10 meters away from the shoreline before Þrein and another bowman shot and killed the three bandits.

Two days later after transporting two barrels of fish from Óssvík to Álahringr, Þrein offered Alfrir to protect his karve for a week and watch over it at night, and will pay him three coppers for every night watched (food is provided). Alfrir agrees and goes with him to guard over the karve.

During his guarding, Alfrir caught two bandits skulking around looking to steal something. Alfrir tried chasing the bandits, but they disappeared into the forest. Þrein heard of this, and decided to give five coppers instead of three after seeing the footprints of bare feet near the coast where his boat was.
