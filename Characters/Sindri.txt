Sindri is one of Randúlfr's knights.



[[APPEARANCE]]
Sindri hair is shoulder-length blond and wavy, his eyes are dark brown, and has fair skin. His left arm is missing, severed by an atgeir during a centaur raid.

He wears a brown woolen cap, brown cloak, a maille hauberk, a muted yellow tunic, brown pants, a ring belt, and a pair of shoes. He wears a iron Talmundúr amulet, and an iron arm ring. He also sports a baldric scabbard with a viking sword sheathed inside. 



[[PERSONALITY]]
Sindri is loyal to his position as a knight. He is also described as being obedient, as he does not want to be dismissed of his social position due to his disability. He doesn't like centaurs due to his experience in the raid. He may have a hard time choosing between personal decisions such as what to eat, and is also pretty quiet because people usually talk to him about his missing arm.



[[Abilities]]
Sindri's main weapon is his sword. He's somehow managed to learn how to ride horses with only one arm, including getting on and off them. He can also play the board game Rægatafl. Sindri speaks Fjallandic as his only language.
