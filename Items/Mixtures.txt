[[OVERVIEW]]
Potions are concoctions and mixtures of different items dissolved into water, and powered by a magic catalyst.

Sometimes, pickling the ingredient is required to make it more acidic, usually for anything that dissolves or break elements down. Fermentation would be required to enhance or make the ingredients more potent if their original properties are too weak to be any use.



[[BREWING STEPS]]
1.  Get a container. Lets suppose it's a small 6 inch cauldron (37 small vials), since ingredients below are assumed a the potion is being brewed in a cauldron.
	
2.  Add water, then add a catalyst. Make sure the catalyst is fully submerged.
2a. If you have magical water, you do not need a catalyst.
	
3.  Add ingredients. Ingredients also must be fully submerged.
3a. Make sure the water isn't a slop, and must be at least as 'watery' as syrup.
	
4.  Boil it, and maintain continuous boiling for two hours. You can also let it sit instead for six hours, but it's potency is slightly lower.
4a. You enhance the effects by leaving it boiling for another few hours, which will increase it's potency by about 25 percent.
	
5.  Let it sit (again if it already sat for 6 hours in step 4) for at least 6 hours for the ingredients to fully dissolve before using.

Based on the amount you drank, the potion could last from minutes to hours. A small vial (50 ml) could last 10 minutes, and a wine bottle (750 ml) could last 2.5 hours.
Most potions require more than 50 ml to be drank to take effect.

Game conversion: 1 ml = 12 seconds, 5 ml = 1 minute



[[SOAKING]]
You can soak various materials in potion to give them potion effects. Every magic item made by people are made this way.

Soaking times:
	Sand, dirt, powder:  Dump it in the potion to make a slop
	Cloth:               Just dip it in
	Wood:                4 hours
	Stone:               6 hours

	Meat:                5 minutes
	Plant:               10 minutes



[[CATALYSTS]]
A catalyst is required to make a potion. Without a catalyst, a "potion" would just be a gross mixture that might make you sick.
A catalyst is an object/liquid that is either magical, or it can be naturally occuring. They are what makes the potion's effect. Any nonliving thing that has an innate magical/natural connection can be considered a catalyst.

Here is a list of magical catalyst examples:
	The snow, or foliage where an intense magical battle happened.
	The grass from a magic academy's training grounds.
	The water from an ancient magical well.
	The core of a slain elemental.
	Water attuned to a god or moon.
	Flesh of a prolonged zombie.

	Basically anything that suffered either long-term magical activity, or short-term intense magical activity (fire bolting or using illusory script the ground a few times isn't going make it magical)

Here is a list of all naturally occuring catalysts, and naturally occuring magical catalysts:
	Cysts (Works better with poisons)
	Bezoars (Works better with potions connected to healing or calming)
	Kidney stones (Works better if you drink the potion and the kidney stones are yours)
	Volcanic ash (Most common ingredient)
	Water from a pond that was recently struck by lightning
	Water of a million-year old geode
	Wood that had been struck by lightning

	Amethyst gorbries
	Any plant, tree, or grass that grew in Veldalfheimr
	Any body part of a glimmering moth, preferabbly the wing or antenne
	Ground daeva horns
	Elemental cores

	Brewing:     Boil the potion for two hours.

	Caution:     Make sure the bees are bees, and not wasps or hornets. Using wasps or hornets turns the liquid into a mucus color, and can cause excessive boiling, or even an explosion.

	Downside:    You need to wait for the potion acid to evaporate before pouring more into the liquid. The liquid stays in the container, and doesn't boil, evaporate, or otherwise leave the container the same way the potion acid does. If poured into any poison, it is twice less effective, which means some poison would need twice the amount of potion acid to distill that amount of poison.

	Brewing:     Boil the potion for two hours.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Usage:       Drink. Only take small doses (< 30 ml) after each meal, or you could instantly go out cold. The liquid should be taken twice a day.
	Effect:      It will kill diseases, viruses, fungi, sicknesses, amoebas, parasites, poisons, etc. Curing a common cold usually requires about six seperate doses to completely heal.
	Downside:    Weakens you, makes you feel tired and sleepy if used a lot, also destroys undigested food. (makes you more hungry)
	
	Ingredients: A small handful of mashed healing herbs, a small handful of mashed relaxation herbs, five mashed mistletoe berries, a ground bezoar, and a pinch of birch sawdust.

	Ingredients: Four crushed practal gorbries, chopped bits of a pickled ekraldys toadstool, a small handful of crushed snail shells, a fermented fly, and a pinch of moon dust from Vel.
	Brewing:     Boil the potion for eight hours. About once every thirty minutes, the potion will start to violently bubble. To stop this, drop a small piece of iron into the unfinished potion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Poison Solvent (advanced)
	Appearance:  The potion is a clear liquid like water, with constant bubbles rising bottom like some boiling soda. It feels to be around 5 degrees warmer than room temperature.
	Usage:       Pour into poison.
	Effect:      Evaporates poison. The same amount of poison solvent must be poured in the liquid to completely evaporate it. The poison solvent will boil and evaporate once it's in the poison, causing the poison to do the same at the same speed. Evaporated poison loses it's effect, preventing any accidental inhaling.
	Downside:    You need to wait for the poison solvent to evaporate with the poison before pouring more into the liquid. If it comes into contact with any other liquid other than poison or poison solvent, it has the same effect except it doesn't actually evaporate the liquid.
	
	Ingredients: Two pickled and crushed practal gorbries, a pinch of coal powder, the fur of an ekraldys toadstool, and a chopped great leafbug leg.

	Usage:       Drink at least 10 ml.
	Effect:      Your skin, starting from the neck, starts to appear small blotches of a mix of black, dark green, and dark yellow colors similar to the potion's appearance, giving it a withered or slightly dyed look. These blotches will spread over your body slowly. The second day, the blotches start showing over your stomach, and you start to feel weak. The third day, the magical skin condition will have spread over your body completely, and you will feel extremely weak, and cannot do more than walk. The fourth day, you will slowly die.
	Downside:    The curse can only spread via consumption of more than a small handful of any organic matter (including saliva, seat, and other bodily fluids) from the affected person.
	
	Ingredients: Three fermented gecko tails, three fermented wasps or hornets, a small handful of ground obsidian powder, a small handful of onyx shards, a pinch of coal powder, and several pinches of wraith ash.

	Brewing:     Boil the potion for two hours.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Appearance:  The potion is an opaque dark tan syrupy liquid.
	Usage:       Drink.
	Effect:      Transforms you into an animal exactly like the spell Polymorph, corresponding to the wooden figurine. If the animal has different breeds, you transform into one that fits best with your personality. You retain your mental capabilities, but the animal to transform can only be lighter than you in weight, cannot possess more strength than you, and cannot be a magical creature. If the potion does not meet these requirements, the potion does nothing and is wasted.
	Downside:    Even though other animals are slightly reluctant to see you as a mating partner or prey, it is still possible. You may also subconsciously make sounds such as purring (if cat), barking (if dog), or anything like an owl's call.

	Ingredients: Two pickled and crushed practal gorbries, a pinch of coal powder, a raw fermented egg of any bird (shells included), a pinch of mashed relaxation herbs, and a carved wooden figurine of the animal to become.

[[REACTIONS]]

Drinking concoction bomb:
	You start to feel full as if you've ate a meal, however you won't gain any nutritions. Also it tastes exactly like wet dirt.

Drinking poison solvent or potion acid:
	Your metabolism is slowed for an hour or two. Also, any potion or poison you consumed earlier suffers the same effect as described in the poison solvent or potion acid effects.

Drinking quickliquid and heavyliquid:
	No effect, because quickliquid is basically the opposite of heavyliquid.

Eating any of the healing salves:
	It doesn't do anything beyond acting as a food.

Eating specifically bone-growing salve:
	Your metabolism is slowed for an hour or two.

Mixing/Drinking conflicting concoctions #1:
	Combinations:
		energy potion and nontoxic seizure concoction
		fire immunity potion and fire-throwing grenade

	Ignites in a fire similar to a lithium-ion battery fire, except the reaction is twice as fast. The reaction lasts until either one of the potion runs out. For example, if you mixed 100% energy potion with 20% nontoxic seizure concoction, it would combust until there was 80% energy potion left.

	If you consumed the potion/salve combination, you die.

Mixing/Drinking conflicting concoctions #2:
	Combinations:
		hailskin potion and fire immunity potion

		gardening growth potion and rotting curse potion
		regeneration potion and rotting curse potion
		regenerative/reverting salve and rotting curse potion

		regenerative/reverting salve and hailskin potion
		regenerative/reverting salve and fire immunity potion
	
	The mixture starts to boil until either one of the potion runs out. For example, if you mixed 100% hailskin potion with 20% fire immunity potion, it would boil until there was 80% hailskin potion left.

	If there are more than three reactions going at the same time, possible explosions can occur.

	If you consumed the potion/salve combination, instead of the boiling reaction happening in your stomach, you slightly lose some sense of balance (basically just dizziness) instead.
